1. Converted our RNN to a LSTM. This change was made after receiving feedback from Dr. Pamplona Segundo. After reviewing the lectures, the notes, and my own personal research
it became exceedingly obvious that the LSTM would be best for the text analysis as it addresses the text as a whole and handles longer text more efficiently.

2. Redid the presentation powerpoint to match the new LSTM model.

3. Added more information to the powerpoint that was previously missing.
